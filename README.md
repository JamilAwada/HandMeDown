# HandMeDown

E-Commerce apps are not a rare sight in the mobile app marketplace. However, they tend to be too broad and general, and rarely attract a niche market. 
For my final Mobile Computing project, I designed and developed an E-Commerce app for the sale and purchase of gently-used and new unwanted baby products.

## Introducing HandMeDown

HandMeDown is an online marketplace for parents to find the products they need for their little angels to grow without overspending. Find everything from toys and clothes
to strollers and formula. Babies outgrow their old clothes and toys very quickly, so why not put them up for sale and help a struggling parent instead of letting them
collect dust in their closet.

## Development Details

The app was developped using the Java language on the Android Studio IDE. I used MYSQL as my database and communicated with the server using PHP-written APIs.
